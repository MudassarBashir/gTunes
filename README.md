A grails application that simulates an online music store.

Attempting to code along with the book 'The Definitive Guide to Grails 2' in order to gain a wholistic understanding of the
Grails framework was the aim of this project. It turned out to be a big hassle. Many examples in the book were not in sync
with the source code of the book and there were also errors within the source code itself. I did write to the author but never
heard back. I reached out to him in the first place because the Apress errata page for the book didn't list any known errors.

I finished reading the book and my copy contains a huge number of corrections. One of the biggest issues in the book is that
references to code snippets called 'Listings' in the book is very erroneous. For example a discussion might start about a code
snippet in say Listing 5-17 but it will be referred to as totally something other such as "We can see that the code in listing
5-23....'. There were so many of these types of frustrating erros that by Chapter 8 I decided to stop coding along and just finished
reading the book to understand concepts instead.

While a good book to read conceptually. I don't recommend coding along with it.
